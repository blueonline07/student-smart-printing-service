HCMUT Smart Printing Service using GitFlow workflow

**Branchs Structure**:

- **`main`**: production branch
- **`dev`**: Main development branch.
- **`feat`** : develop your features here

## Overview

This repository follows a structured branching strategy to organize development efforts across frontend and backend modules. Each sub-branch focuses on specific parts of the application, with `develop` as the main branch for all active development.

## Branching Workflow

1. **Creating New Feature Branches**: 
   - Always branch off from the development branch. For example, if you are developing the authentication page for the web:
      - `git checkout dev`
      - `git checkout -b feat/fe/web/auth`
      - Then start coding from that branch. When done, push your changes to your new branch : `git push origin feat/fe/web/auth` (dont push your code directly to other branches pls T.T)
      - Go to github and create a pull request to `dev` branch

2. **Pull Requests**:
   - Open pull requests from feature branches (e.g., `feat/fe/web/auth`) to the respective parent branch (e.g., `dev`).
   - Wait ulti your PR is merged.
   - After your PR is merged, your branch on Github will be deleted.

## Merging responsibility
   - Team leader will be responsible for merging PR to `main` branch
   - On `dev` branch, the person who tasked the feat will be responsible for mergin that feat to `dev` branch. (i.e. Frontend leader asks the person 1 to do the authentication page, then he will merge person 1 PR, too)
